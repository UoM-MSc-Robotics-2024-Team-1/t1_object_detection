# t1_object_detection
This repository focuses on harnessing the power of the YOLOv5n model to enhance the Leo Rover robot's capability in recognizing and understanding its surroundings through object detection. By identifying the shape, position, and color of objects, this project aims to extend the Leo Rover's interaction with its environment, making it more intelligent and responsive.

Key Highlights:

Shape Recognition: Enables Leo Rover to classify basic shapes, facilitating navigation and interaction tasks.
Position Detection: Empowers the rover to ascertain the precise location of objects, crucial for mapping and obstacle avoidance.
Color Recognition: Enhances the rover's perception system by identifying object colors, useful for specific tasks like object sorting or environmental analysis.

Designed to serve Leo Rover enthusiasts, researchers, and developers, this solution is a step towards creating more autonomous, efficient, and intelligent robotic systems.  Contributions and feedback are warmly welcomed.
